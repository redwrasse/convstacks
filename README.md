# wavenetlike

**Note: This library is a work in progress. To train the original Wavenet on the Speech Commands dataset, run this [script](https://github.com/redwrasse/convstacks/blob/main/convstacks/wavenet_example.py), or [this one](https://github.com/redwrasse/convstacks/blob/main/convstacks/wavenet_example_tpu.py) for TPUs. To access other library functionality currently work directly with source (examples below).** 

### BackgroundÂ¶
A library for building wavenet-like models: generative auto-regressive models with large receptive fields. The canonical example is of course Wavenet itself.

Wavenet is just one in a family of models providing long receptive fields with a reasonable number of parameters. The specific model depends on the data and use case.

This library is built on the Pytorch API.

### Use
Intended workflow
```
import wavenetlike

dataset = Dataset(source)
analyze(dataset)
    waveform lengths
    sample frequency
    correlation lengths
    ...
# perhaps suggest model params based
# off dataset analysis
model = build_wavenetlike(params)
analyze(model)
    total num parameters / depth
    receptive field size
    ...

train(model, dataset)
predict(model, inputs)
```
